You're going to want to install sass into this repository...

Inside this project folder, run the terminal command: `gem install sass`
Depending on your computer, you might have to run in sudo: `sudo gem install sass`

To test that it installed correctly, run the command: `sass -v`
A version number should be returned.

Now run this command to compile the scss file and continuously watch for changes: `sass --watch stylesheets/main.scss:stylesheets/main.css`
Ctrl-C to stop watching.


-- Note from Yunha: I will be pushing the css file so that you may atleast have a somewhat updated css in case the above steps does not work for you
